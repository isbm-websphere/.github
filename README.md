# 🎓 ISBM College GitHub Organization

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **ISBM College of Engineering** – Department of Computer Engineering.  
This organization is created to **host, track, and promote original student projects**, encourage collaboration, and provide a transparent way to assess individual contributions.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Students Join** the GitHub organization using their GitHub ID.

├── README.md -> Project overview, team members, and instructions
├── /src -> Source code files
├── /docs -> Documentation, reports, PPTs
├── /assets -> Images, videos, or other media
└── CONTRIBUTING.md -> Guidelines for team members
